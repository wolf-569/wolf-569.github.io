We are given a file that contains a png file called flag.png.

Running `exiftool` on the file reveals that the file contains `Trailer data after PNG IEND chunk`

![image-center](/images/pico_hideme/1.png){: .align-center}

According to the specification, a PNG file should end at the IEND chunk. Our file has more data than what the image shows.

Running a quick hex view using `xxd` reveals a string called `secret/flag.pngUT`

![image-center](/images/pico_hideme/2.png){: .align-center}

Using the strings command reveals an even nicer view.

```bash
strings flag.png

#secret/UT
#secret/flag.pngUT
```

A quick google search suggested that the file could contain hidden data and some people suggested using `unzip`. And woudn't you know it. It worked! There is a secrets folder with the flag in it.
