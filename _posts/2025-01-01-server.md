I recently built a **Debian server** to host my personal projects, portfolio, and development tools.  
This tutorial walks through how to set up a similar environment — complete with a web server, secure file sharing via SFTP, remote desktop access using SSH/RDP, and a private VPN connection using **Tailscale**.  

At the end, you’ll have a fully functional Debian-based home server that’s accessible securely from anywhere without exposing ports to the public Internet.


---

## Requirements

Before we begin, make sure you have:

* A Debian or Ubuntu-based system (physical or virtual machine)
* `sudo` privileges
* A Tailscale account ([https://tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com))
* Stable Internet connection

> **Note:** This guide assumes you’re familiar with basic Linux commands. If not, take a few minutes to review file permissions, service management (`systemctl`), and basic networking.

---

## Step 1: System Preparation

Update the system and install essential tools:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install vim curl wget git ufw -y
````

Enable the firewall and allow SSH access:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

Check your IP and hostname:

```bash
hostnamectl
ip a
```

---

## Step 2: Web Server Setup

We’ll use **Apache** and **Node.js** for hosting websites and APIs.

### Install Apache

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

You can verify the web server is running by visiting your server’s IP address in a browser.
You should see the default Apache welcome page.

### Install Node.js (for backend or API hosting)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Step 3: Secure File Transfer (SFTP)

You can use the built-in SSH server for secure file transfers via SFTP.

Ensure SSH is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

To connect securely from another machine:

```bash
sftp username@<server-ip>
```

For example, from macOS or Linux:

```bash
sftp wolf@192.168.1.50
```

---

## Step 4: Remote Access via SSH and RDP

### SSH Access

You can remotely manage your Debian server via SSH.

From another device:

```bash
ssh username@<server-ip>
```

### RDP (Remote Desktop)

Install **xRDP** for GUI-based remote access:

```bash
sudo apt install xrdp -y
sudo systemctl enable xrdp
sudo systemctl start xrdp
```

Now you can connect from any RDP client (like Microsoft Remote Desktop) using:

```
server_ip:3389
```

---

## Step 5: Private Networking with Tailscale

Tailscale allows you to connect securely to your Debian server from anywhere, without opening firewall ports.

### Install Tailscale

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Log in via the URL provided in your terminal. Once authenticated, you can access your server from any other Tailscale-connected device.

Check status:

```bash
sudo tailscale status
```

You’ll see something like:

```
100.101.102.103   wolf@debian-server   active; relay "syd" (Australia)
```

---

## Step 6: Network Isolation & NAT Hole Punching

Your server remains isolated from the public Internet — only accessible through your Tailscale network.
Tailscale automatically uses **NAT traversal (hole punching)** to establish peer-to-peer connections, bypassing the need for manual port forwarding.

To verify your server is only reachable via Tailscale:

```bash
sudo ufw deny from any to any
sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0
sudo ufw reload
```

---

## Step 7: Hosting Your Projects

Now you can host your personal projects, websites, or APIs.

Example: Hosting your portfolio at **ashenperera.com**

Place your files in:

```bash
/var/www/html/
```

Restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Your website should now be live within your Tailscale network or through your public domain (if configured with DNS and HTTPS).

---

## Step 8: Optional – Enable HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt

If your server is public-facing, use **Certbot** to enable HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
sudo certbot --apache
```

Renew certificates automatically:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable certbot.timer
```

---

## Testing & Maintenance

Check that all services are active:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo systemctl status xrdp
sudo systemctl status tailscaled
```

Reboot and confirm everything starts automatically:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, reconnect using Tailscale IP:

```bash
ssh username@100.x.x.x
```
